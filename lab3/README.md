# Lab 3: searching and sorting

## Objectives:

- Learn about Algorithms.

- Understand and Implement linear search and binary search.

- Understand and Implement bubble sort.

## Tasks:

1. Implement linear search on an array.
   (Bouns)handle cases where the array contains multiple occurrences of the target element.Display all indices where the target element is found.

2. Implement function for Binary searech algorithm using Iterative Method (loop).

3. Implement function for BubbleSort for doubly linked list.(Swap data) (bouns Swap nodes)
